**This document is still a work in progress**

Install Python 3.6+.
====================
Pansy needs Python to run properly. If you don't have python installed then
go to `Python`_ and install the latest version.
Once you have Python setup, you need to clone this repository and open a terminal inside the folder.
Then you must type:


.. code-block:: bash

    C:\Users\...\Pansy> python shell.py


- You should see: 

    ``Pansy>``

You can exit anytime using the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    exit

Now you are ready to start! ðŸ˜€

How to run a Pansy file ?
=========================
Let's imagine you want to run the code that is in the directory: ``examples/HelloWorld/code.pansy``. 
You just need to use the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    Pansy> run("examples/HelloWorld/code.pansy")

You can also execute your code from outside the Pansy shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    C:\Users\...\Pansy> pansy.py examples/HelloWorld/code.pansy
